      <h1>Title: Looking back to a clear past</h1>




<p>
  
A long time ago, when man's influence on the oceans was limited, the seas were a pure and mysterious world. The crystal clear waters allowed us to see through the water to a fascinating underwater landscape. The water was so turquoise that it seemed like an infinite jewel.

  In the oceans of that time, vibrant marine life formed a spectacular ecosystem. Colorful coral reefs acted as underwater gardens, attracting a variety of fish and other marine life. Schools of fish danced among the reefs, creating beautiful, picturesque scenes. Tuna, sailfish, and sharks move freely through the ocean, displaying their strength and grace.

  Dolphins and whales are the guardians and travelers of the ocean. They swim the vast seas, conveying images of kindness and wisdom. We used to see them leaping out of the water and dancing with the sea breeze, a mesmerizing and wonderful experience.

  Sea turtles are the ancient wise men of the sea, foraging for food at the bottom of the ocean and then swimming leisurely in the blue waters. Their presence is always honored as they represent resilience and vitality.

</p>

  The sea birds are also a magnificent sight. Flying seagulls soar freely through the air, bridging the gap between sea and land. Gulls, albatrosses, and penguins are an integral part of the marine ecosystem, bringing us endless surprises and joy as they search the ocean for food and shelter.
